I will need to try other ways to make the flex items and the media queries to work. So far the things I have tried have not yielded the results I expected. I believe I have to review the flex items behaviors.
Also, I still have to include pseudo classes and pseudo elements. 

Will continue to work in this during the weekend so as to not lag behind.
